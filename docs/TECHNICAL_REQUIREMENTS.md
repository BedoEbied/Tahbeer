## 1. Project Overview

### What is Mihraby?
Mihraby is a **course booking and scheduling platform** where:
- **Instructors** create courses and define available time slots

- ❌ NOT a video hosting platform
- ❌ NOT a content management system
- ❌ NOT tracking lesson progress
- ✅ **ONLY** managing bookings, payments, and scheduling

### Core User Flow
```
Student → Browse Courses → View Details → Select Time Slot(s) → 
Pay (PayMob) → Lock Slot → Auto-create Meeting → Confirmation Email
```

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes, TypeScript
- **Database:** MySQL (Knex migrations)
- **State Management:** React Query, Zustand
- **Payments:** PayMob

## 2. Database Schema Changes

### New Table: `time_slots`
```sql
CREATE TABLE time_slots (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  course_id INT NOT NULL,
  start_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
  end_time DATETIME NOT NULL,
  is_available BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  booked_by INT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  
  FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (booked_by) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  INDEX idx_course_available (course_id, is_available),
  INDEX idx_start_time (start_time)
);
```

### New Table: `bookings`
```sql
CREATE TABLE bookings (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  course_id INT NOT NULL,
  slot_id INT NOT NULL,
  payment_status ENUM('pending', 'paid', 'refunded', 'failed') DEFAULT 'pending',

  FOREIGN KEY (slot_id) REFERENCES time_slots(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  INDEX idx_user_bookings (user_id, status),

);
```

### Update: `courses` Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE courses
  ADD COLUMN slot_duration INT DEFAULT 60 COMMENT 'Duration in minutes',
  ADD COLUMN price_per_slot DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
  ADD COLUMN meeting_platform ENUM('zoom', 'google_meet', 'manual') DEFAULT 'manual',
